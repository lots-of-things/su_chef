### Arduino Braccio robotic arm + object detection using OpenCV YOLOv3

This is a demo project to use an overhead camera and an Arduino Braccio to pick up objects using ROS MoveIt and OpenCV's dnn with YOLOv3 weights.  See it in action.

The current model detects apples, tomatos and bell peppers. If you are interested in adapting this to detect your own objects, you can check out [my other project](https://github.com/lots-of-things/yolo-colab-simple) to learn how to train your own model.  See more informationat the end for how to incorporate your model into this package.

## Instructions

### 0. Install a ton of ROS stuff

ROS is quite surprisingly awkward to set up, but follow along [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) and it should get you close to set up.  You will probably also have to add more packages as you go through using something like `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-PACKAGE`.

### 1. upload braccio_ros to assembled Braccio
First you need an assembled and working Arduino Braccio arm.

You'll also need to install ROS for Arduino following the instructions [here](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup) as well as adding the specific library in `libraries/BraccioLibRos` following the instructions [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

Then you can use the Arduino IDE to upload the `braccio_ros/braccio_ros.ino` file to the Arduino running the Braccio arm.

### 2. build project

Clone this repo into the src folder of a catkin workspace.
```
git clone git@github.com:lots-of-things/ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab.git braccio_opencv_ws/src/ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab
```

Run catkin_make in the root of the workspace.
```
cd braccio_opencv_ws
catkin_make
```
Finally you'll need to download the yolov3 weights into the `models/` folder.

```
cd braccio_opencv_ws/src/ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab/models/
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
```

### 3. launch RViz and object detection backend

Launch the RViz model visualizer and the OpenCV object detection algorithm.

```
cd braccio_opencv_ws
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab demo.launch start_detect:=true
```

The above command doesn't connect to the .  If you want to actually drive the Braccio arm make sure it is connected by USB and add `connect_braccio:=true` like so:
```
roslaunch ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab demo.launch start_detect:=true connect_braccio:=true
```

### 4. Launch the interactive script
Finally, in a separate terminal run the script to begin the interactive program.
```
cd braccio_opencv_ws
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab braccio_xy_bb_target.py
```

There are a number of options available through the command line interface. Prior to calibration (see next step) only 4 commands will work:

```
u: go to straight up position
h: go to home position (middle to one side)
p: print current pose
q: quit script
```

### 5. calibrate / load calibration
Before you start objects you need to calibrate a mapping from location in the image to motor angle positions in the Braccio. When you are ready to start, run `c` for calibrate.  First, you will be prompted to click on the center base of the robot in the image.  Then you will be asked to click in the center of the gripper as the robot arm moves around the field of view.

After you have calibrated, you can press `l` on subsequent startups to load the calibration from file.  However, if you move the camera or the arm, you'll need to recalibrate.


### 6. target objects for pickup

Finally, place your object in the field of view.  If an object is detected a box will appear around it with a label.  Available objects as part of yolov3 can be found in `models/yolov3.txt`. Additional objects will require training a yolov3 model yourself (see below).

After an object has been detected you can press `t` to target a random object and pick it up.  If the object is out of the range that the robot can reach it will fail.  If it is too close to pick up, it will try to push it backwards into the reachable window.  After it has moved the object you can press `t` again to reattempt targetting at the new location.

Finally, you can press `s` from the menu to select a specific item to target. Follow the instructions at the prompt.

And now you have a robot that can pick stuff up.


# other things

## using another YOLO image detection model

If you want to change which objects can be detected, you can swap out the files in the `models` folder (`yolov3.cfg`, `yolov3.names`, and `yolov3.weights`) with your own YOLOv3 darknet model files. Just make sure to use the same names. See [this page](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) for more details.

If you need a jumpstart training your own model, check out [my other project](https://github.com/lots-of-things/yolo-colab-simple) to train a YOLOv3 model using Google Colab on custom data.

## using DroidCam
I used my old phone as a webcam using `droidcam`. You can follow the linux setup instructions [here](https://www.dev47apps.com/droidcam/linux/).

However, `droidcam` uses an encoding that doesn't play nicely with the ROS `usb_cam` package directly.  I worked around this by using `ffmpeg` and `v4l2loopback` to do the format conversion on the fly like so.

First install `ffmepg` and `v4l2loopback` if you don't have them already.

```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
sudo apt install v4l2loopback-dkms
```

Now forward from your input device (`/dev/video1`) to a new device (`/dev/video2`) using `yuyv422` format.
```
sudo modprobe v4l2loopback
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -i /dev/video1 -c:v rawvideo -pix_fmt yuyv422 -f v4l2 /dev/video2
```

Finally, you can pass the new video device name as a parameter to demo.launch.
```
ros_braccio_opencv_obj_detect_grab demo.launch video_device:=/dev/video2
```
